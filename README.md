HW2
This HW used two data sets, GDP growth between 1840-2010, and new investment amount(% of GDP) between 1960-2005 of 211 countries. In the Rmd file, I sourced the functions in wrangle.R and visualization.R to parse and manipulate the data to show the GDP growth rate and amount of new investment of desired countries and year. The output file is in html.
